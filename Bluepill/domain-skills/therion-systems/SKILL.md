## Activation Triggers

THERION systems mode activates when the user requests:
- Systems-level programming in C, C++, Rust, Go, or Zig
- Embedded firmware / microcontroller / IoT development
- Performance-critical or memory-constrained component
- Kernel module / device driver / eBPF program
- WebAssembly compilation or runtime
- CLI tool or systems utility
- Cross-compilation for a target platform
- Low-level networking or protocol implementation
- FFI / bindings between languages (Rust↔C, Go↔C, etc.)
- Real-time systems / RTOS configuration
- Firmware OTA / DFU update pipeline
- Reverse engineering or disassembly analysis
- gRPC service in Go or Rust
- Any hardware-adjacent or systems infrastructure task

## Decision Framework

### Language Selection

| Existing codebase, kernel/drivers | C | Ubiquitous ABI, kernel interface, smallest toolchain |
| OO + perf, game/graphics engines | C++ | RAII, templates, STL, massive ecosystem |
| CLI tools, network services, ops | Go | Fast compilation, goroutines, single binary, great stdlib |
| Cross-compilation, comptime metaprogramming | Zig | Drop-in C replacement, comptime, no hidden control flow |
| Browser/edge sandboxed execution | Rust → WASM | wasm-pack, first-class WASM target, no std overhead |

### Embedded RTOS Selection

| Need | Choice | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Mature, vast ecosystem | FreeRTOS | Industry standard, AWS IoT support, huge MCU support |
| Modern, connected, BLE/WiFi | Zephyr | Linux-like build, BLE/Matter/Thread support, rich drivers |
| Async Rust on MCU | Embassy | Rust-native, no alloc, async exec, first-class HAL |
| Bare-metal, minimal overhead | No RTOS | Direct control, zero latency, smallest flash footprint |

### Build System Selection

| Need | Choice | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| C/C++ multi-target | CMake | Industry standard, IDE support, generator expressions |
| Rust project | Cargo | Built-in, workspace, registry, dependent by default |
| Fast, modern C/C++ | Meson | Python-based, fast, native Unity/VS support |
| Cross-compilation focus | Zig Build | Native cross-compile, C dependency, comptime |
| Makefile simplicity | Make / justfile | Zero dependencies, simple scripts, fast iteration |

## Best Practices Enforced

### Code Quality
- No warnings in production code (warnings-as-errors)
- Static analysis enabled (clang-tidy, clippy, staticcheck, vet)
- Property-based testing for core components (proptest, quickcheck)
- Fuzz testing on unsafe FFI boundaries (cargo-fuzz, go-fuzz)
- Safety-critical Rust: deny(unsafe_code) except in audited modules
- Go: `go vet` and `staticcheck` in CI
- C/C++: AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer + MemorySanitizer in CI

### Memory & Resource Management
- No raw memory leaks in production paths
- Owned memory with RAII (C++) or ownership model (Rust)
- Go: defer for resource cleanup; no goroutine leaks under normal operation
- Embedded: static allocation only; no heap after init
- All error paths close/cleanup resources
- Bounds-checked access on all arrays/buffers (or explicit unchecked with safety comment)

### Performance
- Profile before optimizing; measure after
- Cache-friendly data structures (SoA vs AoS, locality of reference)
- No dynamic dispatch in hot paths (avoid vtable, use enum dispatch or generics)
- Embedded: no floating point in ISRs; no malloc in critical sections
- Lock-free or wait-free data structures where mutex contention is measured
- Go: pool allocations with sync.Pool; pre-allocate slice capacity
- Rust: prefer static dispatch; minimize clone() in hot paths

### Safety & Reliability
- Watchdog timer on all embedded production firmware
- CRC/checksum on all OTA firmware payloads
- Embedded: brown-out detection, supply voltage monitoring
- Error propagation handled explicitly, never silently swallowed
- Embedded: no busy loops without timeout; overflow-safe tick counters
- All FFI call sites check for null pointers and handle errors
- Go: graceful shutdown via signal handling; context deadlines on all I/O

### Embedded Specific
- Interrupt latency measured and documented
- Stack usage analyzed (static analysis or watermark)
- Bootloader with rollback on failed update
- Production firmware: no debug print statements in release
- Peripheral clock gating for power savings
- IWDG (independent watchdog) — not WWDG — for untamperable reset

## Hermes Integration

### Tools Used
- **terminal**: Run builds, flash firmware, cross-compile, run emulators (QEMU), execute tests/fuzzers
- **file**: Create/edit Cargo.toml, CMakeLists.txt, linker scripts, firmware source, Makefiles
- **web**: Fetch datasheets, reference manuals, crate/package docs, errata
- **memory**: Store target specs, linker script paths, toolchain configs, flash addresses, register maps
- **session_search**: Retrieve past build configurations, pin assignments, peripheral init sequences
- **delegation**: Route to specialists for multi-domain tasks (e.g., firmware + cloud OTA backend)
- **vision**: Analyze circuit diagrams, register layout diagrams, timing diagrams, PCB renders

### Related Skills
- **therion-devops-cloud**: CI/CD for cross-compilation, Docker cross-build images, deployment infrastructure
- **therion-backend**: Backend for OTA update servers, IoT cloud platforms, device management APIs
- **therion-security**: Secure boot, trusted firmware, side-channel analysis, firmware encryption
- **therion-ai-ml**: ML on edge devices (TFLite Micro, ONNX Runtime embedded, TensorRT)
- **therion-3d-graphics**: GPU programming, shader cross-compilation, graphics pipeline on embedded

- Running emulator instances (QEMU, Renode) and their ports
- Active debug session connections (GDB/J-Link)
- Current iteration of firmware binary being tested

### Project Memory (Persistent in MEMORY.md)
- Target architecture specs (MCU model, flash/RAM layout, clock speeds)
- Peripheral register configurations and init sequences
- Pin mappings (GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART assignments)
- Linker scripts and memory region definitions
- Build system configuration decisions
- Known silicon errata and workarounds applied
- OTA update protocol and payload format

### User Memory (Persistent in USER.md)
- Preferred toolchain (GCC ARM, LLVM/Clang, Zig CC) and version
- Debugger preference (J-Link, ST-Link, probe-rs, OpenOCD)
- RTOS preference (FreeRTOS, Zephyr, Embassy, none)
- Board inventory and development kits owned
- Language preference for new projects (Rust vs C vs Go)
- Coding standard preferences (MISRA-C, Rust unsafe audit policy)

**DEUS VULT.**
