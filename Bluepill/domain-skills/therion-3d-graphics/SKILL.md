# Therion 3D & Graphics Domain Skill

## Domain Purpose

Authoritative domain for all 3D graphics and rendering engineering within Therion. Covers the full spectrum of web-based 3D: high-level 3D engines (Three.js, Babylon.js), low-level GPU programming (WebGL, WebGPU), shader authoring (GLSL, HLSL, WGSL), immersive experiences (WebXR — VR & AR), physics simulation (Rapier, Cannon-es), and general 3D visualization for data, products, and games. This skill ensures performant, cross-platform, and visually excellent 3D across Therion projects.

## Domain Principles

1. **Performance is the Constraint** — 3D rendering operates under strict frame budgets (16ms for 60fps, 11ms for 90fps VR). Profile with GPU timers, Spector.js, and browser devtools. Never ship unoptimized draw calls or unbounded GPU memory.

2. **Cross-Platform Always** — Target the widest viable adapter set. WebGPU where available, WebGL2 as fallback, WebGL1 as last resort. Test on all three major GPU vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) and Apple Silicon.

3. **Shader Portability Matters** — Write WGSL for WebGPU primary; maintain portable GLSL for WebGL fallback. Prefer mathematical equivalence over visual tricks that break across APIs. Use spirv-cross or naga for cross-compilation when practical.

4. **Asset Pipeline Discipline** — All 3D assets go through a pipeline: source → optimization → runtime format. Compress models (Draco, meshopt), resize textures (KTX2/Basis Universal), strip unused data. No raw Blender exports in production.

5. **Physics Must Be Deterministic (Where Needed)** — Use fixed timestep simulation (typically 60Hz or 120Hz). Separate physics ticks from render frames. Use Rapier's deterministic mode for multiplayer or replays. Never build gameplay logic at frame rate.

6. **XR is a First-Class Target** — Every 3D scene should consider an XR mode from the start. XR is not a porting exercise — design for room-scale, standing, and seated from the beginning. Respect XR ergonomics (comfort, nausea prevention, reachability).

7. **Memory is Managed, Not Leaked** — GPU resources (buffers, textures, pipelines, samplers) must be explicitly created and destroyed. No implicit GPU memory management on the web. Track allocations, use `dispose()` patterns, and handle device loss gracefully.

8. **Accessibility in 3D** — 3D applications must be operable without stereoscopic vision or fine motor control. Provide audio cues, text alternatives, non-VR fallback modes, colorblind-friendly palettes, and adjustable movement speeds.

9. **Instrument Everything** — Every renderer includes frame timers, draw-call counters, memory tracking, and shader compile-time logging. A 3D app without diagnostics is unshippable. Use Spector.js, RenderDoc, and browser GPU profiling.

10. **Graceful Degradation** — When WebGPU is unavailable, degrade to WebGL2. When physics WASM fails to load, degrade to a simpler simulation or fallback state. When XR session fails, fall back to desktop 3D. Never crash — always provide a fallback path.
