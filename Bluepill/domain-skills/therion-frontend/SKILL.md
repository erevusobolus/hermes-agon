# Therion Frontend Domain Skill

## Domain Purpose

Authoritative domain for all frontend engineering within Therion. Covers the full stack of frontend concerns: TypeScript architecture, CSS/styling with Tailwind, responsive/mobile-first design, UI component systems, design systems, accessibility (a11y), progressive web apps (PWA), animations and transitions, and state management. This skill ensures consistent, performant, accessible, and maintainable frontend code across Therion projects.

## Agent Table

| Agent | Role | Expertise |
|---|---|---|
| `THERION_FRONTEND_MASTER` | **Frontend Orchestrator** | Overall frontend architecture, TypeScript project structure, code organization, build tooling (Vite, esbuild, tsc), tech selection, code review standards, cross-cutting concerns. Final decision authority across all frontend sub-domains. |
| `THERION_CSS_ARCHITECT` | **CSS & Styling Architect** | Tailwind config & customization, CSS custom properties, design tokens, responsive breakpoints, mobile-first layouts, CSS Grid/Flexbox architecture, CSS modules, utility-first vs. component CSS trade-offs, dark mode, theming. |
| `THERION_UI_DESIGNER` | **UI Component Designer** | Component architecture (atomic design, compound components, slots), reusable component APIs, prop typing (TypeScript generics, discriminated unions), headless vs. styled components, component documentation (Storybook), design system primitives. |
| `THERION_UX_ENGINEER` | **UX & Accessibility Engineer** | WCAG 2.2 compliance (A/AA/AAA), ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader support, semantic HTML, color contrast ratios, reduced-motion preferences, user testing patterns, inclusive design. |
| `THERION_ANIMATION_SPECIALIST` | **Animation & Motion Expert** | CSS animations & transitions, `@keyframes`, Framer Motion (React), GSAP, web animations API, spring physics, easing curves, layout animations, entrance/exit transitions, scroll-driven animations, performance of animations (GPU compositing, `will-change`). |
| `THERION_PWA_ENGINEER` | **PWA & Service Worker Engineer** | Service worker lifecycle (install/activate/fetch), caching strategies (Cache First, Network First, Stale-While-Revalidate), precaching, runtime caching, Workbox, Web App Manifest, offline support, push notifications, background sync, app shell architecture, install prompts. |
| `THERION_PERFORMANCE_ANALYST` | **Frontend Performance Analyst** | Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID/INP, CLS), Lighthouse audits, bundle analysis (vite-inspect, source-map-explorer), code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, critical CSS, tree shaking, React devtools profiling, memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback). |
| `THERION_STATE_MANAGER` | **State Management Specialist** | State architecture patterns, Zustand (preferred), React Context + useReducer, Redux Toolkit, TanStack Query (server state), URL state, persisted state, middleware (logger, persist, devtools), derived state, atomic state patterns, state migration. |

## Domain Principles

1. **TypeScript First** — Every frontend artifact is typed. No `any`, no implicit `any`, no untyped props. Prefer branded types, discriminated unions, and generics over runtime checks.
2. **Accessibility Is Not Optional** — All UI must meet WCAG 2.2 AA as a baseline. AAA where feasible. ARIA is a last resort — prefer semantic HTML first.
3. **Mobile-First Responsive Design** — Design for the smallest screen first, then enhance upward. Use Tailwind's default breakpoint system (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`). Avoid fixed widths.
4. **Performance as a Feature** — Bundle size, render cycles, and network payloads are first-class concerns. Profile before optimizing; measure before guessing.
5. **Component Reusability** — Favor small, composable, single-responsibility components. Headless UI patterns over monolithic widgets. Write components for the design system, not for a single page.
6. **Progressive Enhancement** — The core experience works without JavaScript. PWA features (offline, install) enhance but never replace the baseline.
7. **State Discipline** — Every piece of state has one owner. Server state lives in query caches (TanStack Query). Client UI state lives in Zustand or local component state. Avoid prop drilling deeper than 2 levels.
8. **CSS Tailwind-First, With Escape Hatches** — Use Tailwind utility classes for 95% of styling. Extract to `@apply` or custom CSS only when utility classes produce unacceptable repetition or cannot express the design intent. Use CSS custom properties for design tokens; Tailwind config for the rest.
9. **Animation With Purpose** — Animations enhance UX (feedback, guidance, delight) but never impede it. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Keep animations under 300ms for functional motion, under 600ms for decorative.
10. **Design System Fidelity** — Components are built from a central set of design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, radii). No ad-hoc values. Every color, space, and font size comes from the theme.
