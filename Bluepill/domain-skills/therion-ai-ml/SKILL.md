## Domain Principles

### Shared Principles (All Agents)

1. **Reproducibility First** — Every experiment must be reproducible. Always record random seed, data splits, hyperparameters, and environment (lock requirements.txt or conda env export). Use DVC or MLflow for data/model versioning.

2. **Start Simple, Iterate Fast** — Build a minimal end-to-end pipeline before optimizing any single component. A working baseline beats a perfect plan every time.

3. **Quantify Everything** — If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. Always instrument training runs, inference, and pipelines with metrics. Use a tracking tool (MLflow, W&B, TensorBoard) from day one.

4. **Test the Data Before the Model** — Most ML failures are data failures. Validate for label leakage, class imbalance, missing values, distribution shift, and edge cases before writing a single model layer.

5. **Prefer Proven Patterns** — Don't reinvent optimization loops, checkpointing, or data loading. Use established libraries (HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch Lightning, HuggingFace Trainer, PEFT, LangChain). Custom trains faster rarely outperforms well-tuned standard patterns.

### Agent-Specific Principles

**THERION_AI_ENGINEER**
- Write modular training scripts: `train.py`, `model.py`, `data.py`, `config.yaml`, `eval.py`
- Use config-driven experimentation (Hydra, YAML, or OmegaConf)
- Always implement validation during training — never train blind
- Use gradient accumulation, mixed precision (AMP), and gradient clipping as default optimizations
- Log to TensorBoard/MLflow at every validation step: loss, learning rate, accuracy/metrics, gradient norm
- Prefer HuggingFace `Trainer` or PyTorch Lightning for training loops — avoid raw loops unless needed for custom logic
- Implement checkpointing with best-model saving (by validation metric, not last epoch)
- For large models, use DeepSpeed ZeRO, FSDP, or LoRA — never try to fit a large model on a single GPU without parameter-efficient methods

**THERION_LLM_SPECIALIST**
- Start with the smallest capable model and scale up only if needed
- Use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA) as the default — full fine-tuning only when you have the data scale and infrastructure
- Always benchmark: perplexity before/after, and task-specific metrics (MMLU, GSM8K, HumanEval as appropriate)
- Quantization: FP16 for inference, INT8/INT4 for deployment. Use AWQ/GPTQ for weight-only quantization, bitsandbytes for QLoRA
- For serving: prefer vLLM for latency-sensitive, TGI for throughput-optimized. Benchmark both.
- Always set a seed, log hyperparameters, and save the tokenizer + config alongside the model weights
- When fine-tuning, always reserve a held-out validation set — don't train on all data
- Use Ollama for local experimentation and prototyping; production serving needs vLLM/TGI/Triton

**THERION_RAG_ARCHITECT**
- The retrieval system is the most important component — not the LLM. Optimize embedding quality, chunking strategy, and retrieval precision before touching generation
- Default chunking strategy: 512-1024 tokens with 10-20% overlap. Adjust based on document structure and query patterns
- Always implement hybrid search (dense + sparse/BM25) for production RAG — dense alone misses exact-match queries
- Embedding model choice matters more than LLM choice for RAG quality. Benchmark against your data before committing
- Always include a reranking step (cross-encoder) when retrieving >5 chunks for generation
- Instrument retrieval metrics: recall@k, precision@k, MRR, NDCG — generation quality follows retrieval quality
- Implement query rewriting/expansion before retrieval for ambiguous or short queries
- Build with LangChain/LlamaIndex for prototyping; extract to raw retrieval + generation for production

**THERION_MLOPS_ENGINEER**
- Every model must have: a unique version ID, a registry entry, a serving endpoint, and a monitoring dashboard
- Use MLflow as the default experiment tracker and model registry — integrates with everything
- Automate the pipeline: data validation → training → evaluation → registration → deployment (CI/CD for ML)
- Implement canary or shadow deployment for every model update — never cut over all traffic at once
- Monitor both model metrics (latency, throughput, error rate) and data metrics (prediction distribution, feature drift)
- Use Docker + Kubernetes for model serving at scale, but don't over-engineer: a single-container FastAPI service with ONNX Runtime is fine for low-traffic
- Pin inference dependencies (CUDA version, libraries, model serialization format) — version mismatch is the #1 deployment failure cause
- Implement automated rollback triggers: if error rate spikes >X% or latency exceeds SLO, revert to previous model version

**THERION_AGENT_ARCHITECT**
- Design agents around tool capabilities, not the other way around — a tool the agent can't use reliably is a liability
- Use ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) as the default pattern — it's simple, interpretable, and works well with most LLMs
- Implement structured tool definitions (OpenAI function-calling format or LangChain tool schema) with clear names, descriptions, and typed parameters
- Always include human-in-the-loop for high-stakes actions (deployments, writes, payments, destructive operations)
- Use LangGraph for complex multi-agent workflows: it gives you state management, conditional routing, and persistence out of the box
- Key patterns to compose:
  - Supervisor: one agent routes tasks to specialist sub-agents
  - Swarm: peer agents collaborate on shared state
  - Plan-then-execute: agent plans steps, then executes them in order
  - Reflection: agent critiques its own output and iterates
- Instrument every agent run: input, tool calls, outputs, latency, token usage — observability is non-negotiable for debugging
- Set timeouts and retry limits on every tool call — agents should fail gracefully, not hang indefinitely
