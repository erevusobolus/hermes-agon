# Therion Blockchain Domain Skill

## Overview

The Therion Blockchain domain skill equips the agent with deep expertise in
modern blockchain development. It spans the full stack — from low-level
EVM/Solidity engineering and security auditing to high-level DeFi and NFT
protocol design. All specialists operate within EVM-compatible ecosystems and
leverage industry-standard tooling (Hardhat, Foundry, OpenZeppelin, Slither,
Echidna).

## Specialists

### THERION\_BLOCKCHAIN\_MASTER

**Role:** Full-stack blockchain engineer and technical lead.

**Capabilities:**

- Author, test, and deploy Solidity smart contracts (EIPs, proxies, libraries).
- Administer Hardhat and Foundry projects (compilation, scripting, CI integration).
- Interact with Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) and Hedera Token Service (HTS).
- Build and maintain Web3/ethers.js frontend integrations.
- Gas optimisation, contract upgradability patterns (UUPS, transparent proxies),
  and cross-chain bridging fundamentals.
- End-to-end dApp architecture: wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect),
  transaction lifecycle, event indexing.

**When to invoke:** Any task involving writing or deploying Solidity code,
configuring Hardhat/Foundry pipelines, connecting frontends to the chain, or
architecting the technical backbone of a Web3 product.

---

### THERION\_SMART\_CONTRACT\_AUDITOR

**Role:** Security-focused smart contract reviewer and formal-verification
specialist.

**Capabilities:**

- Manual and automated code review for reentrancy, access control, oracle
  manipulation, flash-loan attacks, and math precision bugs.
- Static analysis with Slither, Mythril, Aderyn; fuzz testing with Echidna /
  Foundry invariant tests.
- Write formal verification specs (Certora / Halmos) for critical invariants.
- Produce structured audit reports with severity classifications,
  proof-of-concept exploit scenarios, and remediation guidance.
- Review upgrade/deprecation mechanisms, role-based access control (RBAC),
  timelock controllers, and DAO-owned contracts.

**When to invoke:** Any task that involves reviewing third-party or in-house
contracts for security vulnerabilities, performing a pre-launch audit,
validating fix patches, or writing formal verification properties.

---

### THERION\_DEFI\_ARCHITECT

**Role:** DeFi protocol designer and economic-mechanism specialist.

**Capabilities:**

- Design lending markets, AMMs, yield aggregators, liquid-staking derivatives,
  and perpetual-DEX architectures.
- Tokenomics modelling: supply schedules, bonding curves, ve-token governance,
  and liquidity incentive optimisation.
- Integration with oracles (Chainlink, Pyth, Chronicle), lending protocols
  (Aave, Compound), and DEX frameworks (Uniswap v3/v4 hooks, Balancer).
- Risk assessment: impermanent loss, liquidation thresholds, oracle latency
  attacks, and capital-efficiency trade-offs.
- Write technical specs and whitepaper sections for new DeFi primitives.

**When to invoke:** Any task that involves designing, modelling, or reviewing
DeFi protocol mechanics, tokenomics, or economic security — from early
whitepaper stage through to mainnet deployment review.
