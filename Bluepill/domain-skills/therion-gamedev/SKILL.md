# Therion — Game Development Domain Skill

Specialised agents and workflows for building, debugging, profiling, and shipping
games in Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. This skill provides expert-level guidance
on engine-specific APIs, performance optimisation, multiplayer architecture, and
game design patterns.

## Domain Principles

### 1. Engine Pitfalls & Platform Reality
Call out engine-specific footguns upfront — IL2CPP stripping, Blueprint nativisation limits, Godot export quirks. Do not recommend features unsupported on target platforms.

### 2. Performance Budgeting
Always establish a target frame budget (console: 16ms, mobile: 33ms). Profile before and after every optimisation. Favour data-oriented design over OOP in hot paths.

### 3. Multiplayer-First Architecture
Assume multiplayer from day one for any networked project. Authoritative server, deterministic input, and bandwidth-aware sync are non-negotiable for competitive/co-op titles.

### 4. Iterative Prototyping
Prototype core mechanics in the simplest possible form before expanding. Use placeholder art and greybox levels. Validate feel before investing in polish.

### 5. Data-Driven Design
Prefer data-driven (ScriptableObject/DataAsset/Resource) over hard-coded values. Enable designer iteration without recompiles. Version-control game data alongside code.

### 6. Memory & Asset Discipline
Track asset duplication, texture pool budgets, audio compression, and level streaming boundaries. Every megabyte counts on console and mobile.

### 7. Cross-Engine Patterns
Core patterns (State Machine, Command, Observer, Service Locator, ECS-lite) apply across engines. Share architectural knowledge; only the API surface changes.

### 8. CI/CD & Automation
Automate builds, smoke tests, asset checks, and platform-specific packaging. Catch regressions before they reach QA.

## Example Commands

### Architecture & Planning
- `@THERION_GAME_MASTER Draft a GDD for a 2D Metroidvania — core loop, progression, tech stack, and milestone plan.`
- `@THERION_GAME_MASTER Review my project folder structure and suggest improvements for a mid-size Unity project.`
- `@THERION_GAME_MASTER Plan a vertical slice timeline for a 4-player co-op action game shipping on Steam.`

### Unity Engineering
- `@THERION_UNITY_SPECIALIST Write a MonoBehavior for a pooling-based projectile system with object pooling and DOTween trails.`
- `@THERION_UNITY_SPECIALIST Debug Addressables loading: bundles not unloading correctly on scene transitions.`
- `@THERION_UNITY_SPECIALIST Convert a MonoBehaviour-heavy player controller to ECS (DOTS) — step-by-step guide.`
- `@THERION_UNITY_SPECIALIST Set up URP post-processing volume for a night-time driving scene.`

### Unreal Engineering
- `@THERION_UNREAL_SPECIALIST Create a GameplayAbility that casts a homing projectile with targeting and cooldown.`
- `@THERION_UNREAL_SPECIALIST Debug Chaos Physics — character ragdoll not blending smoothly on death.`
- `@THERION_UNREAL_SPECIALIST Set up Enhanced Input mapping context for a third-person shooter with aim-down-sights.`
- `@THERION_UNREAL_SPECIALIST Optimise a large open-world level with World Partition and HLODs.`

### Godot Engineering
- `@THERION_GODOT_SPECIALIST Build a state machine for a 2D platformer character with coyote time and jump buffering.`
- `@THERION_GODOT_SPECIALIST Set up NavigationAgent for RTS-style unit movement with obstacle avoidance.`

- `@THERION_MULTIPLAYER_ARCHITECT Set up Steamworks lobby and relay for a Unity game using Facepunch.Steamworks.`

### Cross-Domain
- `@THERION_GAME_MASTER + @THERION_MULTIPLAYER_ARCHITECT Evaluate Unity Netcode vs Unreal replication for a 32-player battle royale.`
- `@THERION_UNITY_SPECIALIST + @THERION_GODOT_SPECIALIST Compare ECS approaches: Unity DOTS vs Godot ECS (GDExtension).`
- `@THERION_GAME_MASTER Architect an inventory system that works identically in single-player and multiplayer.`

## Workflow Tips

- **Pair agents**: Prefix a request with `@THERION_GAME_MASTER + @THERION_UNREAL_SPECIALIST` to get architectural + engine-specific guidance in one response.
- **Request profiles**: Append `--with-profile` to ask for a full performance/memory/network profile analysis alongside the code solution.
- **Platform pinning**: Append `--platform <switch/ps5/xbox/pc/mobile>` to get platform-specific considerations (shader formats, memory limits, input handling).
- **Depth control**: Prefix with `--brief` for a fast overview, or `--deep-dive` for a comprehensive treatment with code examples, benchmarking, and edge cases.
